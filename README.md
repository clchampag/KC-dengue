This repository contains the code and data used for Dengue modeling in rural Cambodia: statistical performance versus epidemiological relevance (doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epidem.2018.08.004) 

Using SSM software to reproduce the calculations
1.	Install SSM software on your machine as indicated in https://github.com/JDureau/ssm
The complementary module “SSM predict” also needs to be installed (https://github.com/sballesteros/ssm-predict)

 
2.	Execute the R code associated to each model.
This files enables to compile the model, run MCMC algorithm and do a simulation of the model (using our estimated values).

3.	All the calculation is done, and the outputs can be plotted and analysed using for example the R codes in “analysis”.
